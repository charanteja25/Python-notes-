Modules

Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

A file containing Python code, for e.g.: abc.py, is called a module and its module name would be "abc".

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

We can define our most used functions in a module and import it, instead of copying their definitions into different programs.

dir() to now all the names inside module 

we have to add __doc__ to use functions written by others
